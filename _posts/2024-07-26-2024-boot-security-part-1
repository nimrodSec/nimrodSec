As this blog post is based on a university paper I wrote, it is written in a somewhat academic manner. I hope it is not to cumbersome to read. 
The post is about understanding the underlying technologies and necessity of boot security. 
And it is intended to be the first part of a mini-series! The next post will evaluate the most well-known boot security measure: UEFI Secure Boot.   

# The Search For Boot Security Requirements 
## AKA Solving trust-issues with your computer 

### 1. Motivation
In the last years, attacks against the boot process have
become more and more sophisticated. 
In comparison to malware targeting the operating system, boot-level malware is
highly persistent, often sustaining both reboots and re-installs
of a system [1]. 
While advances have been made in improving platform
firmware and bootloader security, most notably in the form
of Secure Boot, ways of circumventing those protections have
been found[2]. 

{: .box-warning}
It is crucial to find effective olutions for establishing a secure and verifiable boot process,
as even security focused operating systems, such as Tails or QubesOS, can not protect
from compromised boot firmware [3].

### 2. Some Fundamentals

#### A. BIOS and UEFI
The system Basic Input Output System (**BIOS**) is the first
piece of software executed on the CPU when a computer
is powered on. 

While historically its role was to provide
operating systems access to hardware, its current primary
role is to *initialize and test hardware components* and *load
the operating system*. In addition, modern BIOS loads and
initializes important system management functions.

There are several different types of BIOS firmware on x86
systems. Most newer systems use boot firmware based on
the UEFI specifications [4]. 

The BIOS has traditionally been considered the **root of trust**
for the operating system. 

{: .box-error}
As the BIOS is the the first code that runs on
the CPU, the BIOS can (maliciously) modify the OS image that
it is supposed to load. Due to the privileged access it has to
all the hardware, it can (maliciously) reprogram all periphery
devices.  Finally, it provides the code that executes in System
Management Mode, thus being able to inject malicious SMM
rootkits at runtime [5].

#### B. Trusted Platform Module
The trusted platform module (**TPM**) is a discrete microchip
found on most modern computer systems. It is tasked with
providing *basic security-related functions*, including securely
storing and generating encryption keys and providing assur-
ances about the state of a system [6]. 

### 3. BOOT-LEVEL THREATS

{: .box-note}
The following sections attempt
to establish an understanding and categorization of *some* possible
threats to the security of the boot process, in order to formulate
according security requirements. Examining all possible types of attacks, all the different
methods of infection and all the various modes of persistence,
not to mention their underlying technical details, is beyond
the scope of this post. 

#### A. Bootloader Attacks

Before diving into the realm of BIOS attacks, it is
important to mention that attacks on the bootloader also exist,
which can sometimes even sabotage the underlying BIOS
security measures. 
The most notable example of this
kind of attacks is **BootHole**.
BooHole effected the GRUB2 bootloader, which is utilized by most Linux systems. 
It enabled attackers to gain arbitrary code execution during the
boot process via a Buffer-Overflow vulnerability, even when
Secure Boot was enabled. An exploit of the vulnerability
would enable attackers to gain persistence thus giving them
near-total control over the victim device [1].

{: .box-warning}
The implications for boot security requirements are that the BIOS must detect changes to the bootloader
and trigger a corresponding action if a change is observed.
The action can range from notifying the user, to refusing to
boot if a modification is detected.

Due to the fact that bootloaders such as GRUB are updated
regularly, managing the trustworthiness of the bootloader is a
serious challenge.


#### B. BIOS Backdoor & Supply Chain Attacks
While the common assumption is that the BIOS arrives to
the user in a trusted state, there is no technical assurance that
this is the case. One possible threat to boot security is the
installation of a backdoor by the BIOS manufacturer (OEM).
A backdoor, as defined by MITRE, is *an intentional malicious
action taken to create and ultimately exploit a vulnerability
in a technology at some point within the supply chain* [17].

{: .box-success}
While no known cases of a BIOS backdoor exist as of the
writing of this paper, targeted backdooring of devices at the
order of law enforcement agencies is technically and legally
feasible, and may be part of the threat model of some users.

Even when no intentional backdoor is installed, the BIOS is
still susceptible to other types of supply chain attacks. 

#### C. Bootkits

Assuming that the system arrives with the manufacturers
intended BIOS installed, and assuming that the manufacturers
BIOS is not backdoored by the OEM, there are still threats to
the integrity of the system BIOS during the systems lifetime,
most notably in the form of bootkits.

Bootkits work by abusing and subverting the operating system
in the course of the initial boot process. 

*A malicious modification of the BIOS code can happen in two main ways.*

{: .box-error}
1. If an attacker with physical access to the device
connects an SPI programmer to the SPI chip, they can
replace the benign firmware contents with a malicious one.
2. An attacker with elevated local privileges can possibly reflash the BIOS, even remotley.

Second way however, requires either a lack of proper reflashing protection implemented by
the original BIOS, or an exploit of the original BIOS to get
code execution rights, before the reflashing locks are applied
or during an update [6].

The implications of bootkits for boot security requirements are similar to those regarding bootloader
attacks, but they apply for the BIOS.

{: .box-warning}
Malicious modifications, such as the injection of UEFI Mod-
ules or the modification of the MBR or VBR, must be detected
and trigger a corresponding action, such as notifying the user
or refusing to boot.
As the BIOS is updated more rarely, managing the trusted
state of the BIOS is less difficult then with the bootloader.

### 4. BOOT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Based upon the above common threats to boot-
level security, the following requirements for a secure boot
process can be formulated:

#### A. Verifiable Initial State
It is necessary that the user can verify, that the installed
BIOS and bootloader are in a trusted initial state.
This can be achieved for example by open source BIOS and bootloader
code with reproducible builds.
In this case, even when the BIOS arrives in an untrusted
state, due to the possibility of a malware infection 'en passant',
the user can compile the BIOS from source and flash it to
the BIOS chip, either internally, or externally via an SPI
programmer.

#### B. Verifiable Trusted State
It is necessary that the user can verify that the BIOS and the
bootloader have not been altered unknowingly.

This can be achieved for example by computing a checksum
or signature of each BIOS component and the bootloader
during each boot, and comparing those to saved, trusted values.
The technical implementation could use a TPM and its PCRs
to manage the trusted state. A security token or an open
authentication app could add a second factor to establish trust
in the TPMs measurements.

#### C. Verifiable Updated State
It is necessary that the user can update the BIOS and the
bootloader and reestablish a trusted state in case of an infection
or a new software release.
In the case of a BIOS update, this can be achieved for ex-
ample by manually recompiling and verifying the new release, internally or
externally flashing it to the BIOS, recomputing the signatures
and checksums of the BIOS components and sealing them to
the TPM.
In the case of a bootloader update, the same applies, except
that the update may be done via the common release channel
of the operating system and that no flashing is involved.

And this is it!
In the next post, I will discuss whether UEFI Secure Boot holds up to those requirements 
(some of you may already guess...).

I am happy about feedback! You can find my contact details [here](/nimrodSec/contact).
