My name is **Nimrod** (they/them), an ``IT-Security enthusiast`` mostly interested in  
- *Linux*
- *Low-Level Security*
- *Applied Cryptography*  

& pretty much anything related to making computers more private and secure.


{: .box-note}
Next to experimenting with technology in my free time, I am also currently finishing a BA in Cyber Security at
*Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences*.

### Besides being a nerd:
When I don't need to troubleshoot my linux system I like to go climbing, read, and spend time with humans or cats (the later preferably).
