## whoami 

My name is ``Nimrod Adam``, I'm an IT-Security enthusiast mostly interested in  
- *Linux*
- *Low-Level Security*
- *Applied Cryptography*  

& pretty much anything related to making computers more private and secure.

Next to experimenting with technology in my free time I am also currently finishing a BA in Cyber Security at
*Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences*.

#### Hobbies
When I don't need to troubleshoot my linux system I like to play chess, go climbing, read and spend time with our cats.
