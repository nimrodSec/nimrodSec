My name is **Nimrod** (they/them), an IT-Security enthusiast mostly interested in  
- ``Linux``
- ``Low-Level Security``
- ``Applied Cryptography``  

& pretty much anything related to making computers more private and secure.


{: .box-note}
Next to experimenting with technology in my free time, I am also currently finishing a BA in Cyber Security

### Besides being a nerd:
When I don't need to troubleshoot my linux system, I like to go climbing, read and play chess.
