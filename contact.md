Preferably, use an encrypted form of communication!

My E-mail is:  
**nimsec (at) systemli.org**

To write an E2E encrypted mail, download my public PGP key [here](/nimrodSec/assets/nimsec-pub.asc).  

After importing the key, make sure the fingerprint matches the following:  

{: .box-success}  
PGP-Fingerprint: 8572 FE58 9565 8958 F048 8E76 D090 A119 39F7 9626

This is a security measure to make sure the key really belongs to me.
